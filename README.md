# Nfl-stats-models

Using Pro Football Reference the data for past nfl games from 2014-2023 was scraped and then altered and combined with the scraped data of the vegas-lines for those lines. That data was then used to create a model that can predict Over/Under and if the spread will hit for future games using past games and trends such as week 1 unders to give accurate results.
